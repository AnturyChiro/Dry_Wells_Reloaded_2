Places radios that play Imperium Radio around Dry Wells. They can be found in the front Legion tents, in the Legion Capture Center (upstairs), the Office of Slavery, on top of the Administration building, inside the Administration building, and in the Legion controlled house above the farm. Also adds one to the water well, but it is off by default - feel free to turn it on if you want more radio locations.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Dry Wells Player Home Footlocker[/b] - Adds a footlocker to the Villa Player Home with Gaius Magnus's armor, his automatic rifle, Constantine's riot shotgun, a machete gladius, ammo, and some Legion money. This is for players who want a bigger reward for completing the main questline, but may have chosen to join Gaius Magnus (or want a second set of armor).[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Dry Wells - Desert Natural Weather Patch[/b] - Requires Dry Wells and Desert Natural Weathers.

This will add a quest with directions to the boat.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The boat will only be available BEFORE nuking Dry Wells. If you nuke Dry Wells, the boat at Cottonwood Cove will activate and this one will disappear.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />[/size][b][size=4]What is the recommended level for Dry Wells - Legion Expansion?[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Level 10-20 is recommended[/b] for the most balanced and challenging experience, but any level courier will be able to enter and enjoy the area. You may find it overly easy at level 30+, or very difficult if you are under level 10.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=4]Recommended tips for stability?[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]SAVE OFTEN. [/b]New Vegas, while a great game, is nearly 15 years old and on an extremely janky engine. Sometimes packages misfire, scripts run incorrectly, or NPCs don't want to go where they are supposed to - and that isn't even beginning to mention bugs from things I might have missed.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]PLEASE do not try to break the quests on purpose.[/b] If you don't let an NPC complete their travel package, rush through something where the mod clearly wanted you to wait for an NPC to speak to you, etc. you WILL be able to lock yourself out of quests. I can guarantee it (as I've done it many times during testing). There are  guardrails in place but please be patient with this mod and understand that this was a labor of love, with all GECK development (outside of custom armors and textures) completed by a single person. Not everything will be perfect, but I strive for it all to be \"good\".[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2] \n<br />[/size][size=4][b]Any tips for a first playthrough?[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]I would recommend siding with [spoiler]Constantine[/spoiler] for a first playthrough as I believe it will be the most rewarding for first-time players and result in what most would consider a \"good\" ending compared to the alternatives. It also has a fun conclusion, which I think people will enjoy.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]I also recommend starting with the Hunters' Guild Questline alongside the Legion questline (as both initial quests are quite easy and provide basically free xp), then the slave freeing questline last. This will result in the most streamlined experience, and provide a very different style of gameplay during each period. It will also allow the player to earn the player home before completing all the quests in Dry Wells.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />[/size][size=4][b]Will you be creating a Long 15 mod?[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Maybe. [/b]I want to see how the reception to Dry Wells is first, and I don't think I have it in me to create another large worldspace without a development team.

This mod is free, and optional to download - which means nobody is forcing you to play it! [/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Constructive, [b]respectful [/b]criticism is welcome, but hateful or otherwise un-productive criticism will be removed. If you find bugs, please keep in mind that most development was done by a single person on their free time, without pay, when you leave your comment. [/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Comments like \"this mod is $#!t and broken\" will simply be removed, and you will no longer have access to any of my work anymore.[/size]\n<br />[/list] \n<br />[size=4][b]Where should I leave bug reports?[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]I would always prefer if bug reports be posted on my [url=https://discord.com/invite/eT4ZnPkztY]Discord,[/url]﻿ as often someone will post a bug report with very little detail and then disappear forever. It helps me greatly if I can understand [b]when [/b]the bug occurred, [b]what [/b]happened, and any additional context you can provide. If we can chat live about it, I'm much more likely to figure out how to resolve it.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Otherwise, please put bug reports in the [b]Bug Reports[/b] section - [b]not the Comments section[/b]. This ensures bugs are easily tracked, and I can change the statuses on them as they are resolved. For tracking purposes, this is much easier on me. [/size]\n<br />[/list] \n<br />[size=4][b]Is this mod compatible with X?[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]This mod was designed with maximum compatibility in mind. I have had multiple playtesters with heavily modded saves run through the main questline, and none have run into any issues. However, with thousands of mods on the Nexus, it is impossible to plan for everything. [/size]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]The following safeguards were put in place to avoid compatibility issues:[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][list=1]\n<br />[*]Almost all containers, weapon and armor leveled lists, etc. are created from scratch. Legionaries are all new, with new custom leveled lists, etc.\n<br />[*]The exception is the Legion faction (and dialogue faction) itself, for obvious reasons. \n<br />[*]Minimal edits were made to the Mojave worldspace and existing areas. Rather than edit scripts on the existing Lonesome Road quests and boat, I simply added a second one and attached new scripts to it. The only exception is Gaius Magnus, which was broken in the Vanilla game and I felt needed to be fixed. He originally would only shoot one bullet from his minigun, before switching to his machete.\n<br />[*]I opted to not add another \"ferryman\" as it didn't seem to add much value, and wouldn't make sense in its current location. I also didn't want to edit the existing Cottonwood Cove Cursor and conflict with other large mods. This way the mod starts when you enter Dry Wells, and (with a few exceptions) ends when you leave it. It is mostly a self-contained world and story, with only a few leaks into the Mojave.\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />[/size][b][size=5][u]Known Issues:[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Villa buildings clip and look a bit funky - I will not be using Dead Money building assets again. They are a total pain in the ass and have no LOD. If anyone would like to take a crack at improving the look of the Villa, please be my guest.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]I am aware that there are only a handful of new weapons/armors in this mod. Despite reaching out to many creators, I was unable to get much assistance with unique items. If anyone would like to help add more in the future, it would be greatly appreciated![/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]This list will be updated as issues are identified. [b]PLEASE post bug reports in the bug reports section, not in the comments.

Below are some additional details you may be interested in!\n<br />\n<br />[/size][u][b][size=4]Main Characters:[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Centurion Gaius Magnus[/b] (Voiced by Noah B) - A ruthless, cunning Centurion with ambitions to become a Legate. The de-facto ruler of Dry Wells, who recently returned from campaign after conquering Caesar's 87th tribe - the Burning Suns (hence, his armor). [/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Centurion Constantine[/b] (Voiced by TheNeoCypher) - A strict, but fair Centurion who has been watching over Dry Wells in Gaius Magnus's absence. Essentially his second in command, and right hand.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Veteran Decanus Proximus [/b](Voiced by Pyro) - Head of the Office of Slavery, and lead slaver in Dry Wells. Serves as one of the main antagonists in the slave-freeing questline, or an ally in Gaius Magnus's main questline.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Diego Ortiz[/b] (Voiced by orpheusmercer) - A traveler born in Arizona, who believes deeply in karma and the saying \"What goes around, comes around\". Has many insights for the player and will serve as an ally (or enemy) in one of the main questlines.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Rick Sawyer[/b] (Voiced by Irakli Chkhikvadze) - Leader of the Hunters' Guild, a new faction the player can choose to ally with or undermine. Rugged, determined, and steadfast.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Trudy Lawson[/b] (Voiced by Tera) - Second in command of the Hunters' Guild. Strong, confident, and defiant against tyrants. [/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Veteran Decanus Remus [/b](Voiced by Crithality)[b] [/b]- Constantine's right hand Decanus. Leads the Dry Wells garrison, and provides contracts and bounties to outsiders.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Prime Decanus Octavius[/b] (Voiced by WasteLord) - Young and determined Decanus with ambitions to lead. Oversees the Dry Wells Capture Center, where slave transfers, prisoners from battle, and interrogation sessions are held.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Thomas Price &amp; Kaitlyn Sanders[/b] (Voiced by Phil Lonidier and Reign Reeves Pearson) - Dry Wells Villa elders. Have seen Arizona before and during Legion rule, and help keep the Villa organized (and out of trouble). [/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Many more characters with deep backstories are in Dry Wells, but these are just a few highlights!\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]Actions and Reactions:[/size]\n<br />[/u][/b][size=2]While Dry Wells is a self contained story separate from the Mojave, there are examples of actions and reactions that affect the game around you. Who you let live or die will affect who you see in Dry Wells after it is nuked, and your actions in the mod will affect people's lives and freedom / safety respectively.\n<br />\n<br />For example, if you free certain named slaves, you may find them in the Mojave later. Additionally, the choices you make in Dry Wells will affect the worldspace after it is nuked.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]Adherence to Lore:[/size]\n<br />[/u][/b][size=2]When writing Dry Wells - Legion Expansion, I attempted to maintain lore continuity as much as possible. I utilized the [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki]Fallout Wiki[/url] and lore videos such as [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiH_RmdNdd8]TheNeoCypher[/url]'s and [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6dMPdDkP9s]nvRanger[/url][/b]'s videos. I also spent many hours discussing and polling New Vegas fans to ensure there were no breaks or flanderization of the Legion. This mod will show the Legion in positive and negative lights, highlighting the safety of their lands while putting their brutality and savage laws front and center. \n<br />\n<br />Because of this, there IS a canon ending for Dry Wells - Legion Expansion. While I created this mod to allow for player choice and freedom, the canon ending to this mod is [spoiler] Gaius Magnus crushing the resistance and restoring order to Dry Wells, as brutal as his methods may be. This decision was made after considering the in-game lore and the fact that he is waiting for you when you reach Dry Wells in the Vanilla game. [/spoiler] I did not want to limit player choice, so YOUR game is considered your own and your actions will have impact, regardless of who you side with or the decisions you make.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the mod! [/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=3]Quest Breakdown and Help:\n<br />[/size][/u]Guided by Ghosts:[/b] [spoiler] Locate the body near the boat, or by the Cottonwood Cove sign. Read their notes, and enter Dry Wells. Speaking to the Front Gate Guard will complete the quest. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Trade Secrets (Legion Quest 1): [/b][spoiler] Speak to the Front Gate Guard. He will refer you to Decanus Remus, in the command tent overlooking the garrison and front gate. Ask Decanus Remus for work.\n<br />From here, you can either kill the merchant, allow the merchant to leave with their life but still resolves Remus's issue, or trick the merchant and allow the Legion to capture him and interrogate him. There is both a low perception and a low speech check in this quest.\n<br />\n<br /> These varying choices will affect your Legion reputation positively or negatively, and will change your reward. Killing Decanus Remus will fail this quest, along with both main questlines. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Voices from the Depths (Legion Quest 2):[/b] [spoiler] After completing Trade Secrets, Decanus Remus will refer you to Centurion Constantine for more work. \n<br />Constantine will introduce himself and his problem, and send you into the mine. There are three possible outcomes to this quest:\n<br />1. Recruit the legionaries in the mine and confront the ghouls in the cave. This will always result in a fight, as you brought Legion with you.\n<br />Alternatively, don't bring the Legionaries with you. This opens more options to complete the quest:\n<br />2. Attack the non-feral ghouls without help\n<br />3. Convince the non-ferals to leave\n<br />4. Convince the non-ferals to remove the rest of the ferals in the sewer connector for you \n<br />When you turn the quest in, you will find Constantine missing and Gaius Magnus in his place. This is where the main story splits, and where you will decide which Centurion you will support.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Once More Into The Deep (Constantine Quest 1):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] After you find out Constantine has been captured, you have the option of aiding him. You will speak to him in the capture facility (the Firehouse) and just butter him up for a bit. \n<br />Tell him he is a good guy. He'll tell you about his plan to escape, and how many of the Legionaries are still loyal to him.\n<br />You will then need to clear out the sewers for him, where he and his Legionaries will escape. There are more options when you speak to Constantine, which lead you down the Gaius Magnus questline.\n<br />NOTE: Completing this quest WILL lock you out of Gaius Magnus's questline. He won't be hostile to you, but you can no longer work for him. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Rallying the Troops (Constantine Quest 2):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] For Constantine to challenge Gaius Magnus, he will need to ensure that many of the Legionaries in Dry Wells are loyal to him. You will need to speak to some of the Decanii around Dry Wells who would potentially support him. Some Decani, like Proximus, would never support Constantine and obviously will not be included in this quest.\n<br />One Decani: Speak to Decanus Remus, and then return to Constantine. This is all you will NEED to do to complete the quest, but will not help you much in the coming fight.\n<br />Two Decanii: The easiest two Decanii to recruit are Remus and Octavius. These two can be convinced to join Constantine just by pointing out the situation they are in, without much effort. \n<br />Three Decanii: Recruiting Decanus Milo in addition to the other two will require a speech check. He is not easily convinced, but will aid you in the final battle if you recruit him as well.\n<br />\n<br />Return to Constantine once you are ready to continue, as once you speak to him in the caves you will not be able to go back and recruit more Decanii. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Redemption Run (Constantine Quest 3):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] This quest may take you 5 minutes, or over an hour depending how you play it. \n<br />You only need to speak to Thomas in the Villa and warn him to keep the people away from the windows, and then you can return to Constantine. Alternatively, there are other ways to solve it.\n<br />\n<br />You can convince Thomas (after a high speech check with Constantine, and another with Thomas or a good Villa reputation check) to allow some of the Villa townspeople to aid you in your fight, which will result in a few of them assisting you.\n<br />\n<br />You can also enlist the aid of the Hunters' Guild. This will require you taking back their lodge, by completing their entire questline. Rick will not consider your offer until then. If you do complete their questline, he will send a couple more hunters to help you. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]The Siege of Dry Wells (Constantine Quest 4):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] Once you are ready, based on a varying amount of NPCs and factions you've recruited, you will start the defense against Gaius Magnus and his soldiers. You will face off against three waves: Primes, Veterans, and then Gaius and his officers.\n<br />\n<br /> You can alternatively choose to betray Constantine at the start of the battle through dialogue, which will turn the entire place into a massive dungeon and turn the Legion [b]permanently hostile towards you[/b]. Gaius Magnus will still attack, and it will effectively trigger a huge civil war in Dry Wells.\n<br />\n<br />[b]IF YOU WANT TO BETRAY THE LEGION BUT NOT HAVE THEM TURN PERMANENTLY HOSTILE TOWARDS YOU:[/b] Start the final fight, and allow the Legionaries to kill each other off. You have to play the part for them to trust you. This will fail the Constantine questline but will not turn everyone hostile against you. You then can mop up the rest of the attackers along with Gaius - this kills the maximum amount of legionaries, while leaving the area intact. If you recruit all the Decani and also complete Unshackled Part III in the specific way that kills Proximus, you will effectively cripple Dry Wells and kill literally every Legion leader in the area without any negative Legion rep. Sneaky! When you return to Nuked Dry Wells, there will be a new Centurion there to take the place of Gaius / Constantine.\n<br />\n<br />This will be a challenging fight at any level, but it will be much easier/harder based on your decisions. If you don't recruit any of the optional NPCs, you will only have around 5 NPCs fighting with you. It will be a difficult challenge to keep Constantine alive. \n<br />\n<br />If you recruit all NPCS available to you, you will have the support of Constantine and his men, three Decanii, three townspeople, and two hunters (and a companion if you brought one). This will make the battle far more winnable. If you are having trouble, I'd suggest taking a forward position and using a hunting rifle or something that does high damage as the Legionaries don't have much armor. My scoped hunting rifle was able to one-shot headshot most of the Legionaries at around level 20. If you complete the Hunters' Guild questline, their special trail carbine is extremely helpful here too.\n<br />\n<br />Once Gaius and his officers are dead, speak to Constantine. He will give you a key to your new player home and the questline will end. A few of the dead NPCs will be scattered around the villa, but they'll disappear next time you enter an interior and return, with the exception of Gaius Magnus and a villa resident or two.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Blood Oath (Gaius Magnus Quest 1):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler] The Gaius Magnus questline is far more focused around being a frumentarius and manipulation to assist the Legion.\n<br />\n<br />Upon finding Constantine captured, Gaius Magnus will offer you more work. Completing this first quest will lock you out of all of Constantine's quests.\n<br />He will ask you to find dirt on Decanus Remus, Constantine's closest ally. \n<br />\n<br />You can either steal a key off Remus (there is also one under his welcome mat), or lockpick his door and steal his journal. \n<br />Alternatively, you can trick Constantine into revealing his backup plan and how Remus and him have discussed their fear of Gaius Magnus in the past. This will also work, and you can turn this into Gaius Magnus for completion. \n<br />\n<br />You cannot speech check Remus into revealing this information, as you are an outsider and he doesn't need your help. It didn't make sense to me to be able to speech check him or something. Constantine is far more lost and desperate. You can, however, confront Remus and tell him you have found evidence against him. He will simply accept his fate, as a brave Decanus should.\n<br />\n<br />Upon turning this quest in, Remus will be publicly crucified in front of his tent for all to see.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[b]The Final Hunt (Gaius Magnus Quest 2):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler] After turning in Remus, Gaius Magnus turns his attention to the Hunters' Guild. You will have two options to complete this quest:\n<br />\n<br />You can either just kill the Hunters' Guild leaders, or lead them into the lodge and show them Gaius Magnus's atrocity - that he happily confesses to you. You will need to complete the entire Hunters' Guild questline to the end, and trick Rick and the other leaders to assault Dry Wells for this to happen. Just tell Rick that he should take his revenge at the very end of the questline, rather than shoring up his defenses and fortifying the lodge.\n<br />\n<br />Gaius Magnus will accept either result, but will be far more happy if you can kill them in such a creative way. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Choosing a Champion (Gaius Magnus Quest 3):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] Gaius Magnus then requests your assistance with picking the next Decanus to lead the Dry Wells Garrison, and replace Remus.\n<br />\n<br />His obvious (and easiest) pick is Proximus, who is quite an evil slave trader and an efficient, brutal leader. \n<br />The other option is Octavius, who will require you to observe (or assist) him in the Sewers as he clears it to prove his combat ability to Gaius Magnus. The two have very different leadership styles, which will instantly become apparent to players.\n<br />\n<br />Gaius Magnus will accept either leader, and if one is dead you will be forced to pick the other. I would not recommend killing Proximus even if you don't pick him, as it will lock you out of a lot of \"good\" options later. You can kill him and gain karma later through another quest.\n<br />[/spoiler][b]\n<br />Extinguishing the Flame of Hope (Gaius Magnus Quest 4):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]Gaius Magnus sends you on a final task, one where he expects excellence and will accept nothing less.\n<br />\n<br />You are sent to the Villa to discover an undercover slave freeing plot. \n<br />\n<br />[b]NOTE:[/b] [b]If you have failed the Unshackled quests for any reason[/b] (by killing Proximus in cold blood / without reason, etc.), your only option to complete the quest will be to kill Diego. You can still complete it, but you cannot get the best rewards or loot for doing so if you have failed the attached questline.\n<br />\n<br />In order to start this quest, you can either speak to Dan Livingston and threaten him, or speak to Diego in the Villa. He will deny the claims at first (if you have not freed any slaves before), but you can search his room after the objective is made available and find a journal to prove that he lied to you.\n<br />\n<br />You can either kill Diego, which will piss off Gaius but technically complete the quest, or solve it in a number of ways.\n<br />\n<br />If you don't want to free ANY slaves, you will need a high speech check or good Villa reputation to convince Diego that you are helping slaves escape through the recently cleared sewers that you just cleared. \n<br />\n<br />If you are okay with freeing slaves (which is a far better option and gives you a lot more content too), take Diego's tasks on and free Paula Freeman, as well as a second slave through Proximus. If you have any confusion, just continue to speak to Diego after freeing each slave and he will start the next quest for you manually - otherwise, you can speak to Paula to start the first slave freeing quest and Proximus to start the second one. Diego will start the third one. \n<br />\n<br />Your choices in the Third slave freeing quest (Unshackled: Part III) will decide the conclusion of this quest.\n<br />\n<br />If you kill Diego and his contact Liberator, Gaius Magnus will be extremely pleased and give you a key to the villa. If you complete the quest in any other way, you will not receive a reward from Gaius - although the quest will complete.[/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Unshackled: Part I:\n<br />[/b][spoiler] While this quest is entangled in the Legion questlines, it can be completed completely separately. Non-Legion players can complete the entire Unshackled questline as well as the Hunters' Guild questline without helping the Legion at all. \n<br />\n<br />Speak to Diego in the Villa, or Paula Freeman in the Mess tent to start this quest. \n<br />\n<br />You can either barter Proximus and gain Paula's freedom, pay the full 400 caps, or convince Proximus that Paula is planning to escape and set the Legion hostile against her.[b] I would not recommend the last option, unless you are just trying to cause chaos. It will lock you out of a LOT of quests.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you choose to free her, you can either set her free immediately or talk to Thomas in the Villa about finding her a home. This will lead to her leaving Dry Wells, or gaining a new place to live in it. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Unshackled: Part II:[/b]\n<br />[spoiler]After freeing Paula, you can either speak to Diego again or to Proximus. This will start the next quest, where you can free another slave.\n<br />Proximus will send you into the fields, where you can speak to four different slaves with different backgrounds and stories. After hearing their stories, you can choose to free one for 200 caps.\n<br />\n<br />If the lines to turn the characters are not popping up for you, make sure you have 200 caps before you speak to Proximus.\n<br />\n<br />Proximus will let them go and comment on which one you picked, and there are varying rewards based on who you chose to free. \n<br />The slaves will can found in the Mojave later, in different places.\n<br />\n<br />Kuno can be found near Camp Searchlight, up the road from Cottonwood Cove.\n<br />Maya can be found near Nelson, where she thought she was returning to an NCR-held outpost.\n<br />Servus can be found near his old home of Nipton, on the road near the famous traffic cone ambush.\n<br />Tribula can be found at the Highway 95 Viper encampment, where she clearly didn't learn her lesson. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Unshackled: Part III:\n<br />[/b][spoiler] After completing both quests, speak to Diego in the Villa. He will lead you into his apartment to speak.\n<br />\n<br />Make sure to wait for Diego to finish his walking package, and start conversation with you. Interrupting him can cause issues.\n<br />Diego confesses that he's been freeing slaves for a long time now, and wants your help. \n<br />Gather 5 stealth boys (you can obtain them from various merchants in Dry Wells first) and then speak to Diego again.\n<br />He will use his, and the four slaves hidden in his apartment will put them on and start running. Ensure they all get out the door before you leave, if you want the full immersion experience. Breaking NPC packages can make scripted events wonky.\n<br />Run down through the beach cave and exit with the freed slaves and Diego, where Liberator is waiting for you.\n<br />When you arrive, you will have a pretty nasty surprise waiting for you.\n<br />\n<br />Decanus Proximus and his slavers have captured Liberator and laid a trap for you. You can either join Decanus Proximus with a legion rep check (or if you are working for Gaius Magnus and his final quest is active, you can tell Proximus that too), barter for their freedom (and barter for a reduced price with a very high barter check), or attack Proximus.\n<br />\n<br />These will land you various rewards and karmas (positive or negative), as well as affect your reputation around Dry Wells and/or the Legion. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Proving Grounds (Hunters' Guild Quest 1):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler] In order to free Paula, or to join the Hunters' Guild, you will need to help them deliver their weekly meat tribute. I would suggest doing this quest extremely early on, as its very easy and opens a lot of content for you.\n<br />\n<br />Simply deliver the package to Paula, and return to Rick. It's as easy as that. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]The Hunter's Call (Hunters' Guild Quest 2):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] After turning in the quest to Rick, he will refer you to speak to Trudy Lawson. She will give you the second quest, where she'll send you to clear out a mole rat cave. In a similar manner, you will simply go and clear out the cave and return. It should be an interesting area, with lots of lore and background information though! \n<br />\n<br />As you exit the top part of the cave, you may run into a crazy Scavenger who has a few ways to handle him. You can either keep him friendly with a survival check, scare him with terrifying presence, or, of course, kill him. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Blood and Bone (Hunters' Guild Quest 3):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] Next, Trudy Lawson will have you enter a Yao Guai cave and complete a difficult hunt, to prove yourself as a great warrior. The cave is on the beach, and is challenging if you run in quickly. However, if you use a shotgun or a hunting rifle/trail carbine it is not difficult to clear, just make sure there is space between you and the animals.\n<br />\n<br />Return to Trudy to move on to the final Hunters' Guild quest. Trudy will declare you a member of the Hunters' Guild, and they will not be \"friends\" with the player [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Reclaim the Wilds (Hunters' Guild Quest 4):\n<br />[/b][spoiler] Trudy refers you to Rick to start the final quest.\n<br />You can speak to Gage to get supplies and a hunting shotgun, which is my recommended weapon for completing this quest.\n<br />Speak to the front Hunter on the bridge, and walk up into the lodge with them. Make sure to allow them to enter the lodge, or their packages won't complete quickly and you may be fighting alone in the lodge for an extended period. \n<br />\n<br />Having a companion with you to help eat up some of the damage is helpful here, or just stick near the front door and shoot the nightstalkers as they come out of the exits. Running down a hallway will aggro a lot more of them, and they'll all come out at once.\n<br />\n<br />After the quest updates from killing the majority of the nightstalkers, you can clear the house fully or enter the basement. Once you enter, head to the dead Legionaries on the ground. Rick will walk up to you and start a conversation. \n<br />\n<br />From here, you can either attack him, convince him to calm down and increase his defenses in the Lodge, or attack Gaius Magnus and the Legion head on (with various consequences). \n<br />\n<br />Constantine will not be able to get Rick Sawyer's help without you first giving them back the lodge\n<br />Gaius Magnus will only be extremely impressed with you if you convince the Hunters to charge him and attack the Legion. \n<br />\n<br />After you convince Rick to keep the lodge and defend it, go into the Villa and wait around for a while. The Hunters' Guild will fix up the lodge and bury their dead, and Gage will go to the mini lodge right down the hill, and will now sell weapons and armor.[/spoiler]\n<br />[b]New Digs [/b](Player Home Quest):\n<br />[spoiler] This quest only triggers by finishing Constantine's questline and defeating Gaius Magnus, or completing Gaius Magnus's questline in a way that impresses him (killing Diego AND Liberator during the showdown).\n<br />\n<br />You will simply need to explore your new home to complete this quest. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Drain Duty [/b](Decanus Octavius's Quest):\n<br />[spoiler] This quest can only be triggered during Choosing a Champion. Speak to Decanus Octavius about becoming the new garrison leader, and he will tell you to wait. Helping him clear the sewers will complete this quest. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Bottom of the Well[/b]:\n<br />[spoiler]Speak to Marty Collins at the Last Drop to start this quest.\n<br />\n<br />The Legionaries at the well have raised the price for his water pickups, and you will have to help him as he can't leave his stand alone. \n<br />\n<br />Speak to Recruit Nemo and either barter for a lower price and make a deal, pay the additional amount required, or lie to Marty and gain a large amount of extra caps (and lose karma). [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Impending Doom[/b]:\n<br />[spoiler] Speak to Sam Davis, the crazy man on the road underneath the Legion Administrative building. He will request a rad suit to prepare for the missile that is coming to destroy Dry Wells (Mars gave him a vision!)\n<br />\n<br />You can either simply give him a rad suit or advanced rad suit (which will make him appear when visiting the Nuked Dry Wells location).\n<br />Alternatively, you can speak to Veteran Ludo on the roof of the Legion Administration building and report that Sam Davis has been speaking about bombs and blowing the place up. They will end the security threat for you. [/spoiler]\n<br />[b]Explorer Notes (Unmarked Quest):[/b]\n<br />[spoiler] Speak to Explorer Lexus in the watchtower near the front gate. He will ask you to help find exploration logs from an explorer who visited the region before the Legion controlled it. The Legion is attempting to remove all traces of the Twisted Hairs tribe, and notes of their existence are included in that. \n<br />\n<br />The notes are located in the following places:\n<br />-Across the river, in front of the Hunters' Guild Lodge. Look for sleeping bags and a duffel bag.\n<br />-Behind the fire station, up high on the rocks in front of the parked/crashed fire trucks.\n<br />-On the way to the Twisted Hair Cave. As you start on the trail up to the cave, pull left and look for a hideout.\n<br />-In the Yao Guai Cave, where the explorer made their final log. [/spoiler]"
